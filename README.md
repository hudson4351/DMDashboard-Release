## ⚠️ Security Instructions (Windows SmartScreen)
Because this is an independently developed hobby project, Windows may display a blue warning screen during installation and/or at runtime that says **"Windows protected your PC."** **Don't worry!** This happens simply because the app is not signed with a $300/year "verified publisher" certificate. The app is safe to run.

**To bypass this:**
1. On the blue warning screen, click **"More info"**.
2. Click the **"Run anyway"** button that appears at the bottom.

| Step 1: Click More Info | Step 2: Click Run Anyway |
